### Why use microservices?
- Monolith architecture can be used when the number of users are not large and the expected users are generally fixed.
- Monolith architecture is not scalable.

- Here is where Microservices come into play
- If the business model of a company plans expand microservices is ideal because it allows the business to scale out.
- Small services can be deployed individually. 
- Each service has a focus on one aspect of the business functionality
- The services are loosely coupled
- They work independently of each other and only communicate with the other services if necessary

- A container is a very lightweight form of a virtual machine. 
- Virtual machines take up a lot of resources and are slow because they have a lot of overhead.
- Docker container has access directly to host OS resources through the docker engine.
