# Microservices

![docker-architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98215575/156015746-11792885-f4d9-4239-b518-fc0f9ed56909.png)


### Why use microservices?
- Monolith architecture can be used when the number of users are not large and the expected users are generally fixed.
- Monolith architecture is not scalable.

- Here is where Microservices come into play
- If the business model of a company plans expand microservices is ideal because it allows the business to scale out.
- Small services can be deployed individually. 
- Each service has a focus on one aspect of the business functionality
- The services are loosely coupled
- They work independently of each other and only communicate with the other services if necessary


  
### Docker

- Docker is an open platform for developing,shipping, and running applications.
- Docker allows you containerize your microservices and simplify the delivery and management of those microservices
- Can anage your infrastructure by using docker containers.
- A container is a very lightweight form of a virtual machine. 
- Virtual machines take up a lot of resources and are slow because they have a lot of overhead.
- Docker container has access directly to host OS resources through the docker engine.

### Virtual Machines vs Docker

## Docker setup and commands
- Follow https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
- open terminal and enter `docker version`
- If you come across an issue with 'None TTY device', enter `alias docker="winpty docker"` in the terminal.
- `docker pull` pull a specific image
- `docker push` push a specific image
- `docker login` adds your credentials
- `docker run -p 2368:2368 ghost` will run the ghost image in our container
- `2368:2368` first port represents the port on our localhost, second number represents the port the image runs on.
- On browser enter `localhost:2368`
- ` docker run -d -p 2368:2368 ghost` to run in a detach mode `-d`
- `docker ps` - shows which containers are running, their id's and other infor
- `docker ps -a` - will show what has been running and acts as a log
- `docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx` nginx
- `docker run -d -p 99:80 nginx` for of port mapping
- Enter `localhost:99` in browser
- `docker stop <id>` to stop the container running
- find the id with `docker ps`
- Resume the container with `docker start`
- `docker rm <id>` to delete the container of the image
- Delete container `docker rm`
- `docker logs <container id> `will show logs for that container if it's run in detached mode
- docker rm 6c58770eea46

### Benefirs of docker:
- Flexibility, can be used on all operating systems very easily.
- Cost-Effectiveness with Fast Deployment
- Mobility 
- Consistent enivronment
- kernel is a layer: that allows your applications to connect to your hardware,
 windows ui, applications, etc


### Hosting static website with Nginx using docker
- `docker exec -it <container-id>` sh this is essentially SSH'ing into the container. `exec = execute`, `-it = interact`, `sh = shell`. Running bash instead
- `docker cp <file.name> <containerid>:<path>/<file.name>` 
- copy the index.html from localhost to 
- to default location of nginx
- `cd /usr/share/nginx/html`
- git bash is sometimes an issue, close the terminal again and run as admin
- run `apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y`
- Then `apt-get install nano -y`
- sudo nano `index.html`
- Make changes to the `index.html`
- To copy the index.html to the container
- `docker cp index.html peaceful_snyder:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html` what i used for nginx
- `docker cp index.html <id or name>:<path>/<file.name>`
- check browswer to see

### Saving image on dockerhub
- run `docker commit <id or name>` e.g.`docker commit peaceful_snyder`
- `docker images` copy desired image id
- `docker tag <containername/id> <username>/<reponame>:<version>` `docker tag cb333be14231 latifsparta/latif_nginx:latest` default verion is latest
- `docker push <username>/<reponame> ` e.g. `docker push latifsparta/latif_nginx`
 exmaple 
- Now run `docker run -d -p <port:port> username/repo` e.g.`docker run -d -p 80:80 latifsparta/latif_nginx`
- You should see the image up on localhost 

#### Automation by using the `dockerfile`: 

```
FROM nginx

# in the background nginx is working to help facilate the users


# label to communicate with team members
LABEL MAINTAINER=latif


# copy data from localhost to container
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

# expose port 80 in this case, for nginx
EXPOSE 80

# launch/create a container which helped us see a coniiner
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
- Run `docker build -t <containername/id> <nameit> .`
- create repo on docker hub
- add the reponame to the next line
- `docker tag <containername/id> <username>/<reponame>`
- `docker push <username>/<reponame>:latest`


```
if you see blockers then it is cause windows has not given permissions to copy folders
you have your web page hosted with nginx
```

### Launching app using docker
- Created a folder with `app` and your `Dockerfile`inside :

```
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY /app /usr/src/app/

#RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```
- run `docker build -t latifsparta/dockerapp .`
- `docker images`
- `docker run -d ip 3000:3000 latifsparta/dockerapp`
- `docker ps`
- rm image and container
- then run image again to see if it works
  
#### Build production ready (Multi-stage build)
- Dependices
- current image is in working state
- listening on required port - port 3000
- copy app folder
- npm install
- npm install express - in some cases
- 
- CMD [node. app.js]
- `localhost:3000` displys node=app-home-page
- add another layer, 
- add prodcution ready layer
- options to compress
- 1) find the slimmer/smaller size of image to use - check `dockerhub` - must support our base image
- create an alias
- syntax --from=app path of WKDIR:new image WORKDIR
- E.g.g size `105gb` to `250mb`aprox 
- 
-  (`/usr/src/app`)

### Reducing the size of an image
- Edit dockerfile
- create app alias

```
FROM node:latest as APP 

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY /app /usr/src/app/ 

RUN npm install

FROM node:alpine

# THis line of code does the magic here to compress the images
COPY --from=app /usr/src/app /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```
Alternative code if problems occur:

```
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install -g npm@latest
RUN npm install express

# THis line of code does the magic here to compress the images
COPY --from=app /usr/src/app /usr/src/app


EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```
### Copying from container to localhost
- run `docker run -d -p 2000:3000 ahskhan/node-deploy-k8:v2`
- `docker ps` find image name
- create a new dir
- cd into it
- enter `docker cp pedantic_feynman:/usr/src/app <filename/`

### Docker compose
Docker compose is good for two or three containers.
Docker compose up will bring up the container to scale on daemon, seldf healing, autosacling

Using Docker Compose ` https://docs.docker.com/compose/ `
- Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
